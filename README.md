# Scala vs C++ vs Go

It're just several projects for testing and benchmarking.

## Notes
<br>For C++ I use articles by next [link](https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Cpp_project_setup_with_cmake_and_unit_tests.html)

### TODO
- [ ] Add tests and benchmarcks for C++
- [X] Add tests and benchmarcks for Go
- [ ] Add tests and benchmarcks for Scala

### PS
*I know I put off this project, but I'm coming back to it*
<br>*I'm gonna work on that in my free time.*
